# TASK 1

## COURSE

![alt text](certificate.jpg)

This task started off with the Crash Course on Python course on Coursera. As I already had some experience in Python, it wasn't too hard. The OOP section taught me some new and exciting concepts.
Loops, functions, iterables, basic data structures, were all covered.

I had to implement a word-cloud project as the final proejct. The jupyter notebook is here in this folder. The project required use of some python concepts and some knowledge about dictionaries. I made a word cloud using the Great Expectations Book on Project Gutenberg.

I used a pip package called word-cloud to create the cloud. I also used matplotlib to plot the cloud. It just generates a word cloud based on frequencies of words, excluding the stop-words or uninteresting words.

## GAMES

### GAME-1

I implemented Tic-Tac-Toe in vanilla Python using the command-line-interface. It is modular and is broken down into many functions, which is easy to understand. It also has many comments.

Sources - https://youtu.be/BHh654_7Cmw, Stack Overflow for some custom functions.

### GAME-2

I also implemented the snake game in Python. I used Pygame 2.0.0 for this. This program is also modular, well commented and easy to understand.
